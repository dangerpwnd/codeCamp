    <h2>The Creation of the D</h2>
    <p>The dynamic duo found each other in the mid 1980s touring together in an actor troupe.</p>
    <p>Once they got past their petty diffences, they formed a band the likes of which have never been seen. Thats' right Tenacious D.</p>
    <p>From playing around and learning each others strengths thru performance they came up with their first hit song. This song was just a tribute to the Metallica song One.</p>
    <h2>Just A Tribute</h2>
    <p>From their hubble beginnings, they went on to create multiple shorts for HBO as well as appearing on the comedy sketch show Mr.Show</p>
    <p>They gained their permanent drummer Dave Grohl, formerly of Nirvana, and released their first self titled studio album in 2001. Their song "Tribute" gained cult-like status overseas as the band began to tour.</p>
    <p>In 2003, they released their first concert DVD "The Complete Master Works", which went on to achieve gold and platinum status by the RIAA.</p>
    <h2>A Bigger D</h2>
    <p>After touring, the band decided to take a stab at the big screen, recording and staring in "The Pick of Destiny"</p>
    <p>Having worked on the script since 2000, they began working with their friend and director Liam Lynch. The story foretold the fictional portryal of the band's formation.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the movie was a flop in the box office, and they quietly escaped the spotlight, playing venues sportaically until 2012.</p>
    <h2>Rize of the Fenix</h2>
    <p>Their "comeback" album was preceded by a mockumentary, titled "Tenacious D - To Be the Best", documented the uncertain future of the D after the box-office failure of The Pick of Destiny, KG's breakdown and incarceration in "an instituion", and Jack's embracing of an indulgent lifestyle.</p>
    <p>On April 28,2012 the album was released in it's entirety on soundcloud where it received positive reviews from music critics.</p>
    <h2>Unplugged and Unprotected</h2>
    <p>Since their last release, the band has completed multiple world tours and has hinted at their next masterpiece.</p>
    <p>Called "Post-Apocalypto" it is said to be released in the very near future.</p>
    <h3>Will the world be ready?</h3>
